## The Haversine formula applied to calculate the zipcode distance from the nearest Station can be found here.

## Note, the Haversine formula includes a CROSS JOIN across two large datasets.
## In order to minimize the size of the query run, we make a few assumptions about the distance between a particular zipcode and a station.
